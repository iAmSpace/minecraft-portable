# iAmSpace's Portable Minecraft
A wonderful C#/Batch/PowerShell program to install any release Minecraft version and all Forge versions.

This script downloads all neccessary Minecraft files and authenticates you (only on C# version as of now), without the hassle of installing, version selecting, and all that.\
The script has seamless version compatibility, ranging from all Minecraft releases to all Minecraft Forge versions! If you're someone who likes OptiFine, don't worry, we **also have that**!

The source code for the C# program is available in this repo, and this program is **not in anyway harmful**, under the Zero Mods release agreement to give notices if any program released under the Zero Mods name is even remotely harmful to any system.
